This chrome extension is bare bones simple. It checks to see if a nexusmods download page is open and if it is, it clicks "Slow Download". Then closes the tab after 10 seconds.



# How to install:

### 1. Download and extract the code.

After downloading the zip file, extract it to your desired location.



### 2. Enable developer mode for Chrome extensions and load the extension
Open chrome and navigate to extensions (put chrome://extensions in your address bar), from there, in the top right corner there is a toggle to turn on developer mode.

### 3. Check to see if it's working.
Once you've selected the extension folder, it should automatically load the exentsion and you should see it under "All Extensions" on the same page.

Once you've confirmed the extension is loaded, navigate to any nexusmods page, find a mod, go to files and click manual download. If it's working it should automatically initialize the slow download.
